This repository demonstrates a common ActionScript error: an index out of bounds error when accessing array elements.  The `bug.as` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.as` provides the corrected version.  The error occurs because the loop iterator `i` potentially exceeds the valid index range of `myArray`. The solution involves carefully checking array bounds before accessing elements.
